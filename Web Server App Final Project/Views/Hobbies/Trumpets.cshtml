            <p>My hobby is to play the trumpet. I have been playing trumpet since 2012 and perform in many different ensembles.</p>
            <p>. Here is a pic of me playing trumpet in the Blue Stars Drum & Bugle Corps. Blue Stars is a competitive marching group that I auditioned to be a part of. All drum corps compete against each other for a superior score.</p>
            <img src="~/images/Seamon_horn.JPG" alt="DCI Horns Up" /> <p>This is an image of me when I was performing for a large audience in a stadium somewhere in the US.</p>
