            <p>Hello, my name is Ben. I am a 4th year Information Technology major in the software development track. I am from West Chester, Ohio and I enjoy playing musical instruments in my free time. I primarily play the trumpet and have been involved in many musical ensembles. I recently participated in marching for a drum and bugle corps that I auditioned for. Drum corps is a competitve marching band activity that requires you to perform high level marching and choreography while playing challenging music.</p>
